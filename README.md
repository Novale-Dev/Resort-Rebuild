# Resort-Rebuild

This project is simply to fulfill my everlonging desire to play more games on Wuhu Island as it was featured in Wii Sports Resort on the Nintendo Wii.

I aim to ship with 6 base gamemodes:

 > Paintball
    - Face off in First Person Shooting action across the island with paintball guns, Nerf-like guns, snowballs, dodgeballs, squirtguns, and more. 
 
 > Dueling
    - Fight with a variety of swords, sabers, polearms, and other melee weapons against your opponent(s) in various locations, including the Swordplay Colosseum.
 
 > Dogfight
    - Fly aireborne vehicles and fight for your life in mid-air combat above the island and the ocean surrounding it.
 
 > Fishing
    - Fish without the worry of licenses anywhere you want in any of the water features the islands, or even far out in the ocean via watercraft.
 
 > Golf
    - Follow through your swings with all the classic Wedge Island Holes, as well as new holes on Wuhu Island.
 
 > Free Playing
    - Find your peace with a varierty of other open-world activities spead across the map while you hang out with your friends.
